## About

We're a team of designers and developers passionate about creating amazing online experiences. At the moment our focus is on building projects from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) platform but we are open to working on all types of front-end web development projects.

We work together to create stunning projects that showcase not only our individual coding skills but also our ability to collaborate and help each other grow and learn. [Join us](https://discord.gg/NYHfjtZE) as we push boundaries to ehance our skills and development, one project at a time.
